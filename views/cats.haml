    We all know that cats love their creature comforts and like nothing better than staying in their own homes. That is why we, at Wags and Whiskers, provide a home visit service which includes feeding, refreshing water and emptying litter trays. Thereâ€™s lots of love and attention on offer for all those cats and kittens who come in from the garden.
